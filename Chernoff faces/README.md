## Source data 
[Mini-Challenge 2 of VAST Challenge 2016](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/varepository/VAST%20Challenge%202016/challenges/Mini-Challenge%202/dataset/MC2%20Data.zip)


## Tasks
### Design Chernoff faces: 
Design Chernoff faces to represent daily parameters for the given control zone of the HVAC system. All controlled zones are described by 8-10 parameters which names start with the name of the controlled zone.

### Implement Chernoff faces library:
Program designed Chernoff faces using MatplotLib. The usage of implemented libraries is strictly prohibited.
